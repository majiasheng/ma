        <h3>What else about me?</h3>
        I am a quite person<br>
        I like to workout<br>
        and do elbow grease (physical work)...<br>
        Yet I like plants<br>
        and I like arts and designs, especially product designs<br>
        I like to organize<br>
        I like to help people<br>
        I have a genuine excited feeling about planning/designing 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and writing new programming projects<br>
        So it is safe to say that I like to create<br>
        However, I often need inspirations to keep the process going<br>
        ...
        <p style="color:white;">
        I want call for standardizations in many of the aspects of different 
        disciplines<br>
        </p>
