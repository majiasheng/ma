		<h3>What else about me?</h3>
		I am a quite person<br>
		I like to workout<br>
		and do elbow grease (physical work)...<br>
		Yet I like plants<br>
		and I like arts and designs, especially product designs<br>
		I like to organize<br>
		I like to help people<br>
		I have a genuine excited feeling about planning/designing 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and writing new programming projects<br>
		So it is safe to say that I like to create<br>
		However, I often need inspirations to keep the process going<br>
		...
